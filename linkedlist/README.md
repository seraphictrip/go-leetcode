## Doubly Linked List

|Operation      |	Big-O Time Complexity	| Notes             |
|---------------|--------------------------|-------------------|
Access          | O(n)                      |                   |    		
Search	        | O(n)
Insertion       |	O(1)*	                | Assuming you have the reference to the node at the desired position |
Deletion	    | O(1)*                     | assuming ref to node |

* assuming have ref means got ref, via access or search, so prob fudging it a little
